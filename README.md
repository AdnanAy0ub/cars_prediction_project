# Cars Prediction Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Cars Prediction Analysis Project** repository! 🚀
This Project demonstrates an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a car models dataset. The goal is to understand the structure of the data,clean the data, identify patterns, and extract insights using statistical analysis and visualizations.
Libraries used are **Numpy and Pandas**, and for visualistaion **Matplotlib and Seaborn**.



🎯 This repository is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in:
- Python
- Data Analysis
- Data Engineering    



#### Objective
- Conduct basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the 
  dataset, handle missing values (if any), and generate key summary statistics.
  
- Perform extensive data visualization to identify patterns, trends, and relationships 
  within the dataset.
  
- Use visualizations not just for analysis, but for storytelling, present insights in a 
  clear, meaningful, and engaging way. 



#### Specifications
- **Import required libraries**: Import libraries like Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn.
- **Data Sources**: Import data from the provided dataset as CSV file.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues (null values etc) prior to analysis.
- **Visuals**: Make relevant visualisations of cleaned dataset.
- **Scope**: Turns data into actionable insights and visuals. 

#### Delivered: 
A well-documented notebook/ report with both analysis and visualizations, 
highlighting the key findings from the dataset.
